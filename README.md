Game 1 - Texas Hold'em - Bryce Ritter

Each player is dealt 2 cards, then 5 community cards are dealt in 3 stages. Each stage players have the option to check, call, raise, or fold. Players seek the best five-card poker hand out of the 7 cards, building and betting on their hand as the round progresses. A player wins the round if all other players fold, or if there are other players after the final betting round initiating a showdown. Upon the showdown, players compare their best 5 card and the winner earns the pot containing all bets from the current round.

Betting rounds:
Preflop - after players have only seen their 2-card hand
Flop - after the first 3 community cards have been dealt (the flop)
Turn - after the 4th card has been dealt (turn)
River - after the 5th and final card has been dealt (river)

Betting options:
Call - match the bet for the current round to continue to play
